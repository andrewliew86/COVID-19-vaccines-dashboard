# COVID-19 vaccination rates and related PubMed publications

Background: The widespread approval and use of COVID-19 vaccines in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Thailand has led to the availability of vaccinations 
data across the different countries. Although a number of websites show the progress of vaccinations in these countries, many of these sites feature a large number of charts. 
This makes it hard to view important information, such as the number of vaccinations administered per day (per million individuals). 
These sites also do not show the latest research related to COVID-19 vaccines. 

Results: I created a Streamlit app that shows the number of vaccinations (per million) administered per country. 
The app also shows the 10 latest papers related to COVID-19 vaccines (from PubMed search). These vaccination rates and publication list are updated dynamically 
each time the app is refreshed - providing up-to-date information on vaccines to researchers and data science enthusiasts.

Python libraries/tools: Standard Python libraries (Requests, Pandas), Plotly, Streamlit

Instructions: Copy and run the script in your local machine.
